<p>The Enhanced Character Separated Values format was developed within
the <a href="https://www.astropy.org/">Astropy</a> project
and is described in Astropy
<a href="https://github.com/astropy/astropy-APEs/blob/master/APE6.rst">APE6</a>
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4792325">DOI</a>).
It is composed of a YAML header followed by a CSV-like body,
and is intended to be a human-readable and maybe even human-writable format
with rich metadata.
Most of the useful per-column and per-table metadata
is preserved when de/serializing to this format.
The version supported by this writer is currently ECSV 1.0.
</p>

<p>ECSV allows either a space or a comma for delimiting values,
controlled by the <code>delimiter</code> configuration option.
If <code>ecsv(delimiter=comma)</code> is used, then removing
the YAML header will leave a CSV file that can be interpreted
by the CSV inputhandler or imported into other
CSV-capable applications.
</p>

<p>Following the ECSV 1.0 specification, array-valued columns are supported.
ECSV 1.0, required for working with array-valued columns,
is supported by Astropy v4.3 and later.
