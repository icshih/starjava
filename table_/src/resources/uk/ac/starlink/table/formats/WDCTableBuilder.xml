<p>Some support is provided for files produced by the
<a href="http://www.wdc.rl.ac.uk/">World Data Centre for
Solar Terrestrial Physics</a>.
The format itself apparently has no name, but files in this format
look something like the following:
<pre><![CDATA[
  Column formats and units - (Fixed format columns which are single space separated.)
  ------------------------
  Datetime (YYYY mm dd HHMMSS)            %4d %2d %2d %6d      -
                                          %1s
  aa index - 3-HOURLY (Provisional)       %3d                  nT

  2000 01 01 000000  67
  2000 01 01 030000  32

]]></pre>
Support for this (obsolete?) format may not be very complete or robust.
